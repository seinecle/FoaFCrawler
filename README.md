FoaFCrawler
===========

Slogan: from the semantic web to gephi

A java package to demonstrate simply how web pages can be crawled and social networks be extracted from them, that Gephi can read.

At the moment it just loops through a local folder that contains html pages.

Improvements needed:
- integration with crawler4j
- integration with a rdfa parser for java (suggestions, anyone?)
